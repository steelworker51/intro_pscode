# Client Task B #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# The starting location would be the entrance of the store or the warehouse
# prompt the user what location would like to visit in the store
# we have the starting location x, then location that the user wants to go to y
# if the store is set up like a lot of large warehouse store location then they are numbered lets say 1-50 in the number of sections
# section 1 would be so many paces inside the store then up then to the right
# so take user inputed location and location of the the number of the section in the warehouse store
# print out how many paces left or right that they need to travel
# print out how many paces up or down that they need to travel
# if they need to find a point again and they are already at one of the numbered sections in the store
# then we would need the users inputed location and the new location they would like to travel in the store
# print out the paces that need to be taken to get to the new location
